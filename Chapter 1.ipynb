    "In quantum mechanics, states and observables are represented using the mathematics of Hilbert spaces. \n",
    "However, their infinite dimensions is incompatible with numerical simulations, that always requires finite elements. \n",
    "Hence, we truncate Hilbert spaces to a finite size, allowing us to run the quantum calculation on a computer.\n",
    "We can thus say that the whole problem of numerical quantum mechanics is then reduced to a problem of multilinear algebra, which is a generalization of linear algebra in tensor products of vector spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of numerical quantum optics stands almost entirely in finding algorthms that allows us to arrive to the aimed result with the smallest possible truncated Hilbert space.\n",
    "However, beside having efficient algorithms, the intricated tensor structures of many-body Hilbert spaces requires also a powerful organization of the code and an easy way to access relevant information."
