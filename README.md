Esempi:
1) Schrodinger time evolution: Harmonic oscillator, Kerr oscillator, Jaynes-Cummings. Initializing the state in a oscillator coherent state while eventual spin is down -> show classical time evolution in Harmonic case, non-linear oscillations in Kerr and collapse and revival in JCM.
2) Driven-dissipative: decay in harmonic oscillator with bath at temperature T. Same calculation with Q-traj and show that it gives the same as ME in average. Same example with Kerr resonator.
3) Bi-stability in JCM: explain classical bistability. Solve the system in ME, show that in quantum there is no bistability. Show that in Q-traj bi-stability translates to strong fluctuations.
