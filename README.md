Esempi:
1. Schrodinger time evolution: Harmonic oscillator, Kerr oscillator, Jaynes-Cummings. Initializing the state in a oscillator coherent state while eventual spin is down -> show classical time evolution in Harmonic case, non-linear oscillations in Kerr and collapse and revival in JCM.
2. Driven-dissipative: decay in harmonic oscillator with bath at temperature T. Same calculation with Q-traj and show that it gives the same as ME in average. Same example with Kerr resonator.
3. Bi-stability in JCM: explain classical bistability. Solve the system in ME, show that in quantum there is no bistability. Show that in Q-traj bi-stability translates to strong fluctuations.
4. TO DO: partial trace completed, Kerr Homework: time evo coherent state, coherent driving in rot frame-> g2, Spectrum, Wigner. Harmonic oscillator driven in rotating frame + full time dependent driving homework->Spectrum and g2. JC spectrum and driven dissipative.
